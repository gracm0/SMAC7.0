    """
    Perform modified BFS in a 3D grid.
    
    Args:
        grid (list): A 3D list representing the workspace, where each element indicates whether
                     the corresponding cell is walkable (0) or not (1). 
        start (list): A list containing the (x, y, z) coordinate of the starting cell in a path.
                       The initial starting position can be configurable in config.py
        goal (list): A list containing the (x, y, z) coordinate of the ending cell in a path.
                      This typically is either the block depot or a block coordinate in the blueprint.
        iw_id (int): This inchworm's ID
        holding_block (bool): A flag that indicates if the inchworm is holding a block or not (which then changes the z).
    Returns:
        path (list[int]): A list of coordinates of the path.
